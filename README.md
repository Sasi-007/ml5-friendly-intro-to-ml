## TLDR
* This is an introductory workshop to machine learning with ml5.js
* Context/Audience: initially prepared for [ITP Camp 2019](https://itp.nyu.edu/camp2019/). ITP Campers are usually creative tech folks or creative tech adjacent
* General overview of machine learning concepts and terms with emphasis on learning through making.
* We use ml5.js, a javascript library to do machine learning for the web. 

## About


Welcome to this friendly introduction to machine learning with ml5.js. We're happy you're here.

### Agenda: ~2.5 hours

+ Hello!

+ Closing notes
+ Farewell + happy camping!

### Key Questions and Takeaways:
+ What is ml5.js?
+ What is the relationship between ml5 and tensorflow.js?
+ Why machine learning in the browser is possible? and why is this amazing?
+ Why machine learning in the browser is important also for democratizing machine learning?
+ Why we need to be able to “poke” at machine learning as creatives - to see how the implications of “state of the art” impact people differently (e.g. face-api expressions? https://joeyklee.github.io/face-api-expressions-demo/webcam/ - notice that it is hard to make certain expressions!)? <!-- TODO -->
