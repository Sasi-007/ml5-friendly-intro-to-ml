## TLDR

* This is an introductory workshop to machine learning with ml5.js
* Context/Audience: initially prepared for [ITP Camp 2019](https://itp.nyu.edu/camp2019/). ITP Campers are usually creative tech folks or creative tech adjacent, but we hope this workshop can be used with audiences of all shapes and types.
* General overview of machine learning concepts and terms with emphasis on learning through making.
* We use ml5.js, a javascript library to do machine learning for the web. 

## About


Welcome to this friendly introduction to machine learning with ml5.js. We're happy you're here.

## Code of Conduct

ml5.js is about machine learning and people.A major part of the ml5.js project is about creating broader engagement with machine learning and its effects on you, me, and the people and environment. As a user of ml5.js you are agreeing to abide by the ml5.js [code of conduct](https://github.com/ml5js/ml5-library/blob/development/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). It's easy and fun to be nice and respectful to those around you. Let's have a wonderful workshop together. If you're looking for more details on what constitutes being "not nice" please see [Mozilla's Community Participation Guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/) which are applicable to the space that ml5.js wants to create. 

If you have any questions or need to report any issues please contact: info@ml5js.org

## Key Questions and Takeaways:

> This is an introductory workshop to machine learning. We are focused on helping you to not only *learn through making* but also start to *reflect through making*. The following questions are here to help focus the **learning** and **reflecting**. 

+ What is ml5.js?
+ What is the relationship between ml5 and tensorflow.js?
+ Why machine learning in the browser is possible? and why is this amazing?
+ Why machine learning in the browser is important also for democratizing machine learning?
+ Why we need to be able to “poke” at machine learning as creatives - to see how the implications of “state of the art” impact people differently (e.g. face-api expressions? https://joeyklee.github.io/face-api-expressions-demo/webcam/ - notice that it is hard to make certain expressions!)? <!-- TODO -->


## The AI/ML universe:

> AI/ML isn't just about advancements in technology, it is about a broader universe of things that are coming together (or diverging). These include changes (or lackthereof) in governance, cultural and social interactions with, awareness of, and attitudes, and feelings towards these new technologies, the development of new tools and communities around and against AI/ML, expansion of AI/ML education, and use of AI/ML in art and design or other domains outside "traditional AI/ML" spaces (e.g. engineering and computer science).

+ [ml5.js **website**](https://ml5js.org/): 
  + The main ml5.js website
+ [ml5.js **organization**](https://github.com/ml5js): 
  + The ml5.js github organization. Here you can see all the repositories that make up the ml5.js project.
+ [ml5.js **library**](https://github.com/ml5js/ml5-library):
  + The main library for ml5.js. This is where all the ✨happens!
+ [ml5.js **examples**](https://github.com/ml5js/ml5-examples):
  + The examples that correspond to all of the functions that are available in the ml5.js library. Emphasis is given to p5.js examples.

  + The examples can be found as well in the p5 web editor. You can run the sketches directly and tweak the examples as you'd like. Note, some of the examples currently do not work in the editor.  

## Terms

> Collected from [Yining's Week 1 of Machine Learning for the Web](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1s0iT382Pl1DMGKb5xhk7_V3DlW1QQHfHs4snNoS_sIU/edit#slide=id.g40fd84b173_0_613)

- **Artificial Intelligence**:
  - AI is the science of making things smart:
  - Human Intelligence Exhibited by Machines
  - A broad term for getting computers to perform human tasks
  - **General AI**: fabulous machines that have all our senses (maybe even more), all our reason, and think just like we do.
  - Most of AI today is **Narrow AI** systems that can only do one (or a few) defined things as well or better than humans.
- **Machine Learning**:
  - One of the Approaches to Achieve Artificial Intelligence
  - A field of computer science that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to "learn" with data, without being explicitly programmed.
  - LOTS OF DATA
  - **Types of machine learning learning styles**:
    - **Supervised Learning**: 
      - Training data is labeled
    - **Unsupervised Learning**: 
      - The machine learn from an unlabelled data set.
      - Unsupervised learning can be grouped into clustering and dimensionality reduction.
    - **Reinforcement Learning**:
      - The machine learn by trial-and-error through reward or punishment.
  - **Types of machine learning outputs**:
    - **Regression**: Predict continuous values (price of a stock)
    - **Classification**: Predict a class/label (cat or dog?)
    - **Clustering**: Most similar other examples (Amazon related products recommendation)
    - **Sequence Prediction**: Predict the next word/sentence
  - **Types of machine learning use cases**:
    - Object Recognition
    - Speech and Sound Detection
    - Natural Language Processing
    - Prediction
    - Translation
- **Deep Learning**:
  - A technique for implementing Machine Learning
  - Deep learning - Uses multi-layered artificial neural networks to deliver state-of-the-art accuracy.
  - Can automatically learn representations/features from data such as images, video or text.
